Arduino Uno:
  Purpose: The Arduino Uno serves as the microcontroller unit (MCU) for the robot car. It runs the program that controls the motors based on commands received via Bluetooth.

H Bridge DC Stepper Motor Controller L298N Module:
  Purpose: The L298N module is an H-bridge motor driver that allows the Arduino to control the direction and speed of DC motors. It acts as an interface between the Arduino and the DC motors.

DC Stepper Motors and Wheels:
  Purpose: These motors are the actuators that drive the wheels of the robot car. The L298N module controls their rotation (forward, backward, left turn, right turn) based on signals from the Arduino.

Bluetooth Module:
  Purpose: The Bluetooth module enables wireless communication between the robot car and a controlling device (such as a smartphone or computer). It receives commands sent via Bluetooth and forwards them to the Arduino for motor control.

Battery (9V or 12V):
  Purpose: The battery provides the necessary power to operate the Arduino, L298N module, motors, and Bluetooth module. It is essential for the mobility and operation of the robot car without being tethered to a power source.
